-- uStimNet --
network trained on one session of hand sorted data, which had labels for spikes, noise and microstimulation artifacts.
The network is trained to allocate waveforms to two classes 
class1 = spikes, class2 = noise+ustim artifacts

-- uStimNet_artifact --
network trained on one session of hand sorted data, which had labels for spikes, noise and microstimulation artifacts.
The network is trained to allocate waveforms to two classes 
class1 = uStim artifacts, class2 = spikes+noise
